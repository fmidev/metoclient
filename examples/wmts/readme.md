# WMTS Layers

This example demonstrates how to configure an alternative WMTS base map layer.

Install the project dependencies.

    cd examples/wmts
    npm install

Create a bundle for the browser.

    npm run build

Open `index.html` in a browser.

The base map can be changed in the layer switcher in the top right corner. Also WMTS time series layers are supported.
